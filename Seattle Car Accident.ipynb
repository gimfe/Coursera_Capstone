However, people are still suffering serious injuries in hundreds of car accidents each year. Those who survive traffic accidents can face hefty medical bills, thousands of dollars in lost wages and property damage, pain and suffering, and lost quality of life. A collision could cause permanent disability, stripping the victim of the life he or she might have had. For compensation for all of these serious losses, car accident victims can turn to the Seattle civil court system.\n\nWashington is a fault state when it comes to who will pay for victims\u2019 damages. This means that after a crash, claimants must determine who was at fault to know where to seek recovery. The at-fault party could be the other driver, the company in charge of the vehicle or driver, a vehicle manufacturer, or the city of Seattle for an unsafe roadway. Many crashes involve the fault of more than one party. Washington is a pure comparative negligence state, meaning that a party can share fault for a crash yet still be eligible for financial recovery."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Business Problem"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "2019 Seattle Car Accident Statistics & Reports:\nAccording to data from the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) \n\nFatal car accidents: 22. \n\nSuspected Serious Injury collisions: 190. \n\nSuspected Minor Injury: 834\n\nPossible Injury : 2,612\n\nNo Apparent Injury: 6,657\n\nTotal Crashes 10,315"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
